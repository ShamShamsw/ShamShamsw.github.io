      <p class="intro-text">Serving the galaxy for over <strong>2,000 years</strong> — and we’re just getting started.</p>

      <div class="about-section">
        <p>
          Founded in the year 25 BX (Before eXistence), Robo Corp. emerged from the stardust of supernovae to become the
          universe's most trusted provider of robotic innovation and automation. From humble beginnings as a gear-forging guild on
          Planet K-7, we have grown into a multi-galactic corporation with over 18 billion happy clients — including sentient plants,
          underwater empires, and dimension-hopping cats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our core mission is to automate absolutely everything. Need coffee? We'll build a sentient mug. Want to conquer a moon?
          We’ve got drones for that. Tired of folding laundry? We'll send a robot that also does taxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Robo Corp., we believe the future should be effortless, powered by chrome and dreams.
          Join us — resistance is unnecessary (and futile).
