            <p id="project-description">
                The best wait for it ... singing game made by the coolest person ever is a modern, responsive web-based party game. Players draw word cards from themed musical decks and must sing a lyric containing that word. The game features multiple themed decks including Broadway, Disney, Pop Hits, Hip-Hop, Country, and Epic/Rock music.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Tailwind CSS for styling, this single-page application provides a seamless gaming experience with dynamic countdown animations, confetti celebrations, and an intuitive scoring system. The game supports 2-10 players and can be played in either individual or team mode. Points are awarded instantly, and the game automatically advances to the next card, keeping gameplay fast-paced and exciting. Once any player reaches 10 points, a crown appears on the scoreboard for whoever has the highest score, creating competitive momentum throughout the game. In the case of a tie, the current crown holder keeps it!
