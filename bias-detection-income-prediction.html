            <p id="project-description">
                This project is part of a class assignment focused on identifying and interpreting bias in machine learning models. Using the Aequitas toolkit, we analyze potential educational bias in an income prediction model trained on 1994 U.S. Census data. The goal is to evaluate how bias may impact business decisions, such as selecting a location for a new boba tea store. Some information is redacted for privacy reasons.

            <h2>Objectives Completed</h2>
            <ul id="objectives-completed">
                <li>Imported and preprocessed the "US Adult Income Data" dataset.</li>
                <li>Set education level as the protected attribute with "Bachelors" as the reference group.</li>
                <li>Selected fairness metrics: False Positive Rate Parity and False Negative Rate Parity.</li>
                <li>Generated a Fairness Report using Aequitas with a disparity intolerance of 80%.</li>
                <li>Interpreted the results to assess bias and its potential impact on business decisions.</li>
            </ul>
