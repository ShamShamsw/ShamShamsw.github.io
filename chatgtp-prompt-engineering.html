            <h2>Full project description</h2>
            <p id="project-description">In a compact two-hour session I created and documented a small, practical prototype inside the ShamShamsw/ChatGTP-Prompt-Engineering repository focused on prompt engineering for generative models. The work concentrated on delivering clear, reproducible notebook examples that demonstrate key prompt patterns, evaluation checks, and usage notes so others can run, review, and extend the experiments immediately.</p>

            <h2>What I set out to do</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Define a clear 2-hour goal: produce one or more runnable Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate practical prompt-engineering techniques and include explanatory notes.</li>
                <li>Prioritize the minimum viable demonstration that communicates the idea and is reproducible by others.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Scoping and plan: 10-15 minutes to clarify purpose, audience, and success criteria.</li>
                <li>Implementation: 60-75 minutes to create and iterate on notebooks with runnable examples, prompts, and explanations.</li>
                <li>Validation and fixes: 10-15 minutes to run notebooks, verify outputs, and address issues.</li>
                <li>Documentation and README or site copy: 10-15 minutes to add usage instructions for reproducibility.</li>

                <li>No automated tests or extensive performance or edge-case testing added in this session.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Add clearer filenames and a top-level README with links to each notebook if multiple notebooks exist.</li>
                <li>Add automated checks that execute notebooks or convert them to tests (for example, nbval).</li>
                <li>Polish narrative and visuals in the notebooks, and add example outputs or screenshots for the web page.</li>

            <p id="project-description">In a focused two-hour session I produced a runnable Jupyter Notebook prototype that demonstrates practical prompt-engineering patterns and example prompts. The notebooks include explanatory notes and smoke-tested examples so you can run, learn, and extend the experiments right away.
