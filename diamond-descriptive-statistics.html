                This project explores the relationships between various factors such as carat size, cut, color, and clarity, and their impact on diamond pricing. Through regression modeling and statistical analysis, we aim to uncover insights into how these variables interact and influence the value of diamonds.

            <ul>
                <li>Analyzed R-square, P-values, and coefficients to evaluate model performance.</li>
                <li>Segmented diamonds into small, medium, and large categories based on carat size.</li>
                <li>Developed regression models for each category to compare variable impacts.</li>
                <li>Interpreted results to identify significant trends and insights.</li>
