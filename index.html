    <p class="center-text">
      My love for IT began in 2009 with Code Ninjas. From that moment, I knew programming was what I wanted to pursue. Throughout high school, I took introductory programming and advanced mathematics courses. After learning programming in some AP classes, I began creating projects using C++, Python, and SQL. I went on to pursue my bachelor's degree in Business Information Technology at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater. During my time there, I developed practical skills as a campus leader—both academically and as a role model—serving as a Resident Assistant in two of the largest housing complexes on campus. In addition to strengthening my soft skills, I also developed administrative capabilities and gained foundational knowledge in AWS, cloud computing, machine learning, and business analytics. I am currently seeking a position that allows me to leverage my broad range of technical and interpersonal skills.
