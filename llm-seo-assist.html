            <p id="project-description">LLM-SEO-ASSIST is a private tooling project that applies large language models to streamline and scale SEO workflows. The program helps teams generate SEO-focused content (titles, meta descriptions, H1 and H2 suggestions), produce content briefs, perform on-page optimization checks, suggest internal linking and schema markup, and create audit reports tied to measurable SEO signals. It is designed to integrate LLM outputs with SEO best practices and analytics data so businesses can produce consistent, search-optimized content at scale while preserving editorial control.</p>

            <h2>Hypothetical example (illustrative, non-private)</h2>
            <p id="project-description">A mid-sized e-commerce company used a private deployment of LLM-SEO-ASSIST to optimize 300 product pages. The tool analyzed product attributes and search intent, generated keyword-aligned titles, meta descriptions, H1 and H2 outlines, and short product descriptions. It also produced brief technical recommendations (canonical tags, structured data) for engineering to implement. Over three months, the company observed improved organic visibility and click-through rate on targeted pages.</p>

            <h2>Accomplishment (illustrative)</h2>
            <p id="project-description">Example accomplishment (hypothetical): The tool produced standardized, keyword-aligned content and technical recommendations for 300 pages, contributing to an estimated 25 percent increase in organic page visits and improved SERP positions for targeted long-tail queries within three months after implementation.
