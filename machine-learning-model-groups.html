            <p id="project-description">
                This program aims to solve the challenge of creating balanced and randomized student teams for group projects. It ensures fairness by introducing random variations while maintaining team size constraints. The program uses an Excel file as input for student data and outputs the generated teams into another Excel file.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Randomized team generation to ensure fairness.</li>
                <li>Customizable team sizes and variation factors.</li>
                <li>Prevents overfitting by avoiding repetitive patterns in team assignments.</li>
                <li>Scalable for large datasets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Importance of Avoiding Overtraining</h3>
            <p>
                Overtraining or overfitting in data models can lead to biased results that fail to generalize to new scenarios. This program ensures diversity in team assignments by introducing controlled random variations, which helps prevent repetitive patterns and promotes fairness.
            </p>
            <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
            <p>
                The model could be extended to solve additional challenges, such as incorporating skill levels or preferences into team assignments, or optimizing for specific project requirements.
