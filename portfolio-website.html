            <p id="project-description">This is page going over my digital portfolio! I'm passionate about building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web experiences using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With a strong foundation in web standards and design principles. I enjoy creating dynamic interfaces that not only function flawlessly but also look great on any device. I also work with JSON for data handling, and I use Git and GitHub to manage projects and collaborate efficiently. Whether it's a sleek landing page or a full-scale interactive web app, I bring ideas to life through code and creativity.
