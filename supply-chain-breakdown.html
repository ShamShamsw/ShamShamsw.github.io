                <h2>Importance of Optimized Solutions</h2>
                <p>
                    Understanding the importance of generating the most revenue within the available time is crucial in supply chain management. Constraints such as factory hours or the productivity of workers during an 8-hour shift play a significant role in determining efficiency. By analyzing these factors, businesses can make informed predictions and optimize their operations to minimize disruptions and maximize output.
